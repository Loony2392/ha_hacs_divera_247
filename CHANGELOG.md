## [2026.08.1] - 2026-08-13

### 🔐 Security

-   **Access key no longer leaks into the Home Assistant log**: The Divera access key is sent as a URL query parameter, and aiohttp embeds the full request URL in its exception representation. Several error handlers logged the exception object directly — in `trigger_probe_alarm` at ERROR level — writing the access key to the log in cleartext.

    -   **Impact**: Anyone with access to the HA log (including uploaded diagnostics and support bundles) could read the access key
    -   **Action**: If you have shared HA logs previously, rotate your Divera access key

-   **Access key is no longer sent to unvalidated hosts**: The config flow collected validation errors but issued the API request regardless, transmitting the access key to a base URL that had just been rejected as invalid.

### 🐛 Fixed

-   **Invalid access keys now report as an authentication error**: `remove_params_from_url()` discarded the result of `URL.with_query()` and raised `ValueError` when called without arguments. The exception handlers therefore failed inside themselves, so an invalid access key surfaced as a generic crash instead of `DiveraAuthError`.
-   Applied the request timeout to `set_state` and `trigger_probe_alarm`, which previously had none
-   Guarded `exc.request_info` access, which is absent on a plain `ClientError`

### 🔧 Maintenance

-   Scoped GitHub Actions workflow permissions to least privilege
-   `npm audit fix` on the semantic-release dependency tree

## [2026.01.0] - 2026-01-09

### 🔐 Security

This release includes critical security fixes addressing multiple GitHub Security Advisories.

#### Fixed Security Vulnerabilities

-   **XSS Prevention in Energy Dashboard**: Added HTML escaping to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in helper entity names and status fields

    -   Applied `html.escape()` to all user-provided data displayed in sensors
    -   Affected fields: `helper_firstname`, `helper_lastname`, `helper_status`
    -   **Impact**: Prevents malicious HTML/JavaScript execution in HA frontend
    -   **Status**: ✅ Fixed in `sensor.py`

-   **HTTPS-Only URL Validation**: Implemented strict HTTPS enforcement for API base URL

    -   Prevents Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks via HTTP downgrade
    -   Validates URL format and hostname structure
    -   Allows localhost exception for development environments
    -   **Impact**: Ensures encrypted communication with Divera 24/7 API
    -   **Status**: ✅ Fixed in `config_flow.py`

-   **API Request Timeouts (DoS Prevention)**: Added request timeout configuration

    -   Total timeout: 30 seconds
    -   Connection timeout: 10 seconds
    -   Read timeout: 20 seconds
    -   **Impact**: Prevents hanging connections and Denial-of-Service scenarios
    -   **Status**: ✅ Fixed in `divera247.py`

-   **Input Validation Enhancement**: Strengthened validation for sensitive configuration
    -   API Key length check: 10-1000 characters
    -   Scan interval validation: 60-3600 seconds
    -   Base URL format verification with regex
    -   **Impact**: Prevents invalid or malicious configuration values
    -   **Status**: ✅ Fixed in `config_flow.py`
